# My First Flutter App ðŸš€

I created this project while following the [Write Your First Flutter App](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab) codelab. This was my first experience with Flutter, and I learned a lot about building mobile apps with Dart.

## ðŸ“Œ What I Learned
- Setting up Flutter and running a project
- Understanding the project structure
- Using widgets like `MaterialApp`, `Scaffold`, and `ListView`
- Managing state with `StatefulWidget`
- Adding external packages (`english_words` for word generation)
- Navigating between screens
- Using icons and interactivity

## ðŸ”¨ How I Set Up the Project
```sh
# Created a new Flutter project
flutter create my_first_flutter_app
cd my_first_flutter_app

# Got dependencies
flutter pub get

# Ran the app
flutter run
```

## ðŸŒ± My Thoughts
This was an exciting introduction to Flutter, and I look forward to building more complex apps. The ability to create cross-platform apps with a single codebase is really powerful!

## ðŸ”— Resources I Used
- [Flutter Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs)
- [Dart Language Guide](https://dart.dev/guides)
- [Flutter Codelab: Write Your First Flutter App](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
